                                     Microkernel Architecture (OSGi Framework)

This is an OSGi system implementation of the producer (Publisher) â€“Consumer situation. Microkernel Architecture was used in this program and this was deployed by Eclipse Equinox. Our Group creates this simple OSGI architecture for hospital management Services. Microkernel Architecture was used to create this Hospital Management Service Whichwas built with Java and Apache Felix OSGI Framework. There are separate service bundles as producers(Publisher) and to consume that service as a consumer. To get best practices of the OSGi we used producer service interface only not the implementation Consumers can work through the interfaces.
